Development works of 2011

I visited a website called gamebanshee that had a lot of video game walk-throughs.  Their layouts were to the website's layout and did not follow the theme of game.  I wanted to create a walk through for myself.

I created on for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II.  I started working on them.
